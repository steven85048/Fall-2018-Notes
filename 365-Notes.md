## What are Threats?
___

### _(DEF) Threat:_
    Unwanted Piece of Code; has malicious intent
        e.g. Javascript plugin that runs code on behalf of you
    
### _(DEF) Ransomware_
    Software that threatens to publish user data in exchange for money or compensation

### _(DEF) Insider Threat_
    Threat that results from somebody inside the organization

### _(DEF) Phishing_
    Email or link that poses as an another individual in attempt to scam the victim.

### *Examples*
    1. Packet Sniffing - Listening to packets sent on the public network
    2. Physical Security - Access to hardware to cause malicious intent

### Categories of threats:
    1. Disclosure
    2. Deception
    3. Disruption
    4. Usurpation

### _Things to Note_
    1. It is important to understand the motives of the malicious individual truly understand their threats.

## Common Threats
___

### (DEF) Snooping
    Definition: Listening on a communication channel that you shouldn't have access to

### (DEF) Modification/Alteration
    Definition: Changing the data before it reaches the destination
        e.g. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks - violate the integrity of the messages in between senderes

### (DEF) Masquerading/Spooing
    Definition: Posing as a certain agent in attempt to obtain a reward as that agent
        e.g. Pretending to be a certain website to make someone click on a link

### (DEF) Repudiation 
    Definition: Ability to check if a person actually said something online

### (DEF) Denial of receipt 
    Definition: Denying that a service or contract actually occurred

### (DEF) Delay
    Definition: Increasing the amount of time it takes for a transaction or service to be completed
        e.g. Increased stock exchange delay for other investors = less profit

### (DEF) Denial of service
    Definition: Blocking legitimate users from using the service

## How to Defend Against Threats?
___

    1. Create a policy that forces users to use a higher security
        e.g. A password security threshold
    2. Additional Hardware for increased security
        e.g. More servers to increase DDOS difficulty
    3. Predict what a attacker might do to prevent the attack from occurring
        e.g. Penentration testers
    4. Audit and log all passed information to react to threats after they happen

### Boils down to two things
    1. Security policy - What things are you requiring your users/employees to do?
    2. Security mechanism - What processes are in place to prevent threats?

    Policy vs mechanism - Policies are more people-oriented approaches; mechanisms are more technical

## Example
___
    Consider: A house is something we want to defend

    Potential threats: 
        1. Intruders - Unauthorized individual who wants to enter the house
        2. Natural disasters - Physical destruction of the property
